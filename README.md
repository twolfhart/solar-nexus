Solar_Nexus

The Solar-Nexus project is a fork of the HSMM-Pi project in which certain features are added:

1) Access Point ability:
	This feature uses two wiresless devices on non-gateway nodes, allowing users to use security and the ability to be forwarded on to the Ad Hoc mesh which will use a few techniques to obscure itself from non-node connections. This at least gives some basic security measures.

2) Updated web site:
	Not only has the design of the website been updated, based on MIT's CakePHP framework, but the device web page includes the added features.
